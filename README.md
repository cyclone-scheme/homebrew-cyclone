# Homebrew Cyclone 

Formulae for the Cyclone Scheme compiler.

## How do I install these formulae?

* `brew tap adamfeuer/cyclone`
* `brew install cyclone`

That will install the `cyclone-bootstrap` formula, bootstrap the `cyclone` compiler, 
and then install the full `cyclone` compiler via the `cyclone` formula.
